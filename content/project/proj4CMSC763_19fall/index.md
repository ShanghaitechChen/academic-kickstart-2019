title: "Randomized Singular Value Decomposition: A Study"
summary: "In this project we study randomized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
Apart from the standard randomized SVD algorithm, two modified versions,
one for eliminating the influence of the round-off error and one for adaptively
determining a desired error threshold, are introduced and discussed. Their ef-
ficiency and stability are demonstrated by experiments on two test matrices,
one is a given matrix which has full rank and slowly-decaying singular values
and the other one is generated from the numerical solutions of a piece-wise con-
stant diffusion equation. A special treatment when the input matrix is positive
semi-definite is also discussed and validated with numerical results."

In this project, we study randomized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Apart from the standard randomized SVD algorithm, two modified versions, one for eliminating the influence of the round-off error and one for adaptively determining the desired error threshold, are introduced and discussed. Their efficiency and stability are demonstrated by experiments on two test matrices, one is a given matrix that has full rank and slowly-decaying singular values and the other one is generated from the numerical solutions of a piece-wise constant diffusion equation. A special treatment when the input matrix is positive semi-definite is also discussed and validated with numerical results.
